The theme \"AI in Action: From Perception to Decision\" captures the essence of this dynamic journey—starting from how AI systems sense and interpret the world, to how they analyze data and take intelligent actions. This subject explores the various subdomains of AI such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Expert Systems, each playing a vital role in transforming raw data into actionable insights. From facial recognition to language translation and autonomous driving, AI is embedded in real-world applications all around us. The poster presentation aims to bring out these innovations, showcase creative ideas, and inspire new perspectives on the potential of AI. Participants will dive deep into the AI lifecycle and highlight how perception leads to intelligent decisions in machines. Join us to witness the future unfold through the lens of AI in Action: From Perception to Decision.\n",

This event invites students from all departments to collaborate and push the boundaries of innovation by designing and constructing floating structures — from houseboats to mini floating cities.\nParticipants will apply their technical skills and design sensibilities to create waterproof, buoyant structures capable of maintaining stability on water. The challenge is not just about floating — it's about redefining liveable spaces on water.\nDuring the final test, all models will be placed in water to assess buoyancy, stability, and structural integrity under real conditions. Teams are encouraged to explore sustainable and waterproof materials, drawing inspiration from modern amphibious architecture and marine engineering.\nWhether you're building a floating pavilion or a futuristic water home, this challenge is your platform to innovate, collaborate, and make a splash!\nKey Character:\nTeamwork: Teams can have up to 4 members, and individual participation is allowed.\nDesign Requirements: The design should be capable of floating on water. The or structure should be designed to support a minimum weight.\nSubmission format: A video demonstration or explanation of the design process, making of the structure for scratch as well as a description of the materials and methods used, must accompany the submission.\nModel Size Limitation:\nThe useable area is 10.00 Sq.m. \nThe size of water tank in diameter is 1.14m and depth 0.25m. Model should float easily in the water tank.\nTeams may choose any shape or configuration (e.g., rectangular, modular, circular) within the size limit.\nThere is no fixed height restriction, but the structure must remain balanced, safe, and buoyant during testing.\nModels that exceed the allowed size may be disqualified \n",

Teamwork: Designers work in teams, usually 3-4 members.\n2.   Time-sensitive: Teams have a limited amount of time (e.g., 60-90 minutes) to complete each design task.\n3.   Sequential challenges: Teams participate in a series of design challenges, each building upon the previous one.\n4.   Collaborative problem-solving: Team members work together to brainstorm, sketch, and refine their designs\n\n",
